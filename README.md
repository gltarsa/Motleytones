This app serves up the Motley Tones website. It has been designed so that it should be
possible to customize it for other bands or applications.  Feel free to fork a copy and
make it work for you.

### Development Notes (Mac OS X)

Building this app from scratch requires the following:

* `brew install postgres`
* Start PostgreSQL: `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start`
  or `brew services start postgresql`

For completeness, there is also:

* Stop PostgreSQL: `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop -s -m fast`
  or `brew services stop postgresql`

Note: when upgrading Mac OS X you may find postgres does not start properly due
to missing directories. These commands will create empty versions of those
directories, which should remedy the problem:

```mkdir /usr/local/var/postgres/{pg_tblspc,pg_twophase,pg_stat,pg_stat_tmp,pg_replslot,pg_snapshots}/```
```mkdir /usr/local/var/postgres/pg_logica{l,l/mappings,l/snapshots}```

### Miscellaneous

The styling of this app is generally based on an original static page created
by Rebecca Tarsa using the [HTML5 Verti design](http://html6up.net/verti).  It
no longer uses any of the original code or packages.
